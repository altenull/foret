## Motivation

The Forest Design System is a personal project started to experience the creation of a design system.

First, I needed a brand before building a design system. Since I was always interested in nature, I created a fake brand called Foret, which has a mission of 'creating a green space within the living area for modern people in the city.'

After creating the brand, I defined design principles that serve as guidelines to follow when approaching the design system. Within the design principles, I selected basic elements of the design system such as color and font that match the brand, and developed UI components based on them.

## Getting Started

The Foret Design System is available in [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Angular](https://angular.io/) versions.

If you're looking for React version, check out [`foret-react`](./foret-react). If you're looking for Angular
version, take a look at [`foret-ng`](./foret-ng).

Here's a full list of packages that are included in Foret Design System.
